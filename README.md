It works pretty simply add your reminder in the input field and also the due date
so that way you know when to do it. When we add a reminder to our list of reminders
to take care now we could just have number due date but the application also decides
to make these dates more readable and friendly to human interpretation.
Another great thing about this application is we don't have to keep the web app
open for it to remember everything it uses browser cookies so if i refresh destroy
a history of reminders so that whenever you will revisit them you will see your
same reminder on the page.
we can delete reminders when we completed them also we can delete reminders
all at once when you have completed everything.
I learned so much more about react and the awesome redux library when building this application.
